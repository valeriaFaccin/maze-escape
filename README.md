# maze-escape

A simple first-person maze game built with **Three.js** and **Cannon-ES**, featuring physics-based movement, animated characters, enemy encounters, and a countdown timer.

## Overview
The player must navigate a procedurally generated maze before time runs out. An enemy character periodically appears near the player, reducing remaining time on contact. Reaching the maze exit results in a win; letting the timer reach zero results in a loss.

## Controls
- **W, A, S, D** — Move
- **Mouse** — Look around
- **Click** — Lock pointer / start game
- **Esc** — Pause (unlock pointer)
